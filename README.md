Location-Based Analysis: Understanding restaurant popularity, pricing, and ratings across various cities and neighborhoods.
Cuisine Preference Analysis: Identifying the most popular cuisines and their associated price ranges.

Key Insights:

Popular and highly rated restaurants in different cities.
The correlation between cost and ratings.
Regional food preferences and top-performing cuisines.
Sentiment trends in customer reviews.



2. Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project
Project Description: The Hotel Booking Data Analysis project involves analyzing a hotel booking dataset to identify booking patterns, cancellation trends, and factors affecting hotel performance. This project helps hotel management optimize operations, reduce cancellations, and improve customer experience. The project includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data to handle missing values, formatting date fields, and categorizing customer types (e.g., families, couples, business travelers).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding booking trends such as peak seasons, average length of stay, lead time before booking, and cancellation rates.
Customer Segmentation: Identifying key customer segments (e.g., leisure vs. business travelers) based on booking behavior and demographics.
Cancellation Analysis: Analyzing the factors that lead to cancellations, such as long lead times, room types, or booking sources.
Revenue Analysis: Studying how different factors (e.g., booking channels, room types, duration of stay) influence the hotel's revenue.
Key Insights:

Booking trends by season and lead time.
Factors contributing to higher cancellation rates.
Customer types and their impact on revenue.
Popular booking channels and their effect on occupancy rates.
